# SpotiFlow Data Stream
## A Modern Spotify Data Engineering Project

### Overview
SpotiFlow Data Stream is a serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes Spotify data using AWS cloud services. The project automatically collects, transforms, and analyzes Spotify track, artist, and album data, making it available for analytics through Amazon Athena and extendable to Snowflake for advanced analytics capabilities.

### Architecture Components
1. **Data Extraction Layer**
   - Spotify API Integration using Python
   - AWS Lambda function for data extraction
   - CloudWatch Events for scheduling (daily trigger)

2. **Data Storage Layer**
   - S3 buckets for both raw and transformed data
   - Organized folder structure for different data types
     - `raw_data/`: Initial data landing
     - `transformed_data/`: Processed and cleaned data

3. **Data Processing Layer**
   - AWS Lambda for data transformation
   - S3 event triggers for automated processing
   - Data quality checks and schema validation

4. **Analytics Layer**
   - AWS Glue Data Catalog for schema management
   - Amazon Athena for SQL queries and analysis
   - Future extension: Snowflake integration
